## Getting Started
The game is written in Prolog and requires *GNU-Prolog* to run. You can download it by using the command `sudo apt-get install gprolog` in Linux terminal or through [here](http://www.gprolog.org/#download) for other OS.

_If you have SWI-Prolog, you would still need to install GNU-Prolog as the game may not run at all in SWI-Prolog._

Having installed GNU-Prolog, navigate to the game's directory and use the command `[gone].` to compile the game. After that, type `start.` to run the game. The game should run and show additional instructions. Type `instructions` for a list of available commands.

_Please note that the game runs on Prolog. That means **every instructions have to be ended with a period.**_

## Gameplay
The game revolves around time. The time itself would advance by a pre-determined time for every commands entered by the player. There are 10 unique endings to the game, try to find them all.

## FAQ
### I cannot run the game at all, help?
Make sure you are using GNU-Prolog, and not other compiler such as SWI-Prolog or Yet Another Prolog. If you have GNU-Prolog and still have troubles running the game, I suggest reading the [GNU-Prolog manual](http://www.gprolog.org/manual/gprolog.html).

### Why is it made with Prolog? I think _<insert\_language\_name>_ will be more suitable for this kind of game.
It was made as one of our class assignment in programming logic. I, personally, did not know that it was possible to make games with Prolog. We were taught to use GNU-Prolog as far as determining the truth value of a statement, given a collection of other true statements. So this game is really an eye-opener that Prolog could be used to make such games.

### How long did it take to make the game?
It took 2 days to make the storyline and game concept. The game itself took 4-5 days to code.

### Why is the game different to the concept?
A concept is just that, a concept. Due to Prolog limitations (or our own limitations), we were unable to create the exact same gampelay that was initially intended. But that does not necessarily means the game is worse than the concept. We added a lot of alternative endings to the game and also minute details that are not present in the concept.
